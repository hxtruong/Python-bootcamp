# Learn Python Course
#### Note some interesting things
-- Self-taught
## Python Object and Data Structure Basics
- Power in number: ** . Ex: 2**4 = 2^4 = 16
- Negative index in string. Ex: str= 'Truong' -> str[-1] = 'g' mean this last character of string
- Get character in string: str[START:END:STEP]. Note: not including character[END]
- Function Split:
  * str.split() -> split each word in a string as array
  * str.split('i') -> split until meet character 'i'. Ex: str = "Hello! This is an bird." -> 'Hello! Th', 's ', 's an b', 'rd.'
- Format in print: use '{}'.format  to print string/result follow defined format
- Set just get the unique element. Ex: myset = set(); myset.add(element)
- IO file
  * open(), read()
  * when read() file, the cursor will be moved the end of file. Use seek(int) to set again cursor
  * read() evert line: readlines() -> list string follow each line in file
  * with open('myfile.txt') as my_new_file:
      contents = my_new_file.read()
      -> file open and close automatically, the contents in file will independence with file
## Statements
- Key word 'enumerate' use show (index, result) in loop
- Key word 'Zip' use zip lists together follow index
## Function
- * args : list of parameter when pass to Function
- ** kwargs:  return a dictionary  
- map: use match between list argument with parameter of function. Ex: map(square, my_nums) -- square is function, my_nums is list number
- filter: use filter element follow condition. Ex: filter(condition,list)
- lamda parameter:return. Ex: lamda num:num%2==0
- Scope:
  * use 'global' in def to get value of global variable (re-assignment)
  * code clearly: x = function(x) when re-assignment variable; def function(x): #code -> return x
## OOP
- Init function: def __init__(self, parameterm,...)
- Inherit: class Dog(Animal): -> Dog Inherit from Animal
  * Call again class parent: def __init__(self): Animal.__init__(self)
  * If call a function which is not define in children class, it will inherit form parent class. In contract, children will use own function if it has same name.
  * Polymorphism: A class have many parents class.
- Special method in class:
  * __str__(self): call str(name class) to describe what this class is.
  * __len__(self): return length of class (anything you want)
  * __del__(self) -- del class: use to delete from memory of computer
## Modules and Packages
- if __name__ == "__main__": check if this file .py is run directly
## Unit Test
## Map(), reduce(), filter()
### Reduce()
- from functools import reduce
### Zip()
- zip() makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
- Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. With a single iterable argument, it returns an iterator of 1-tuples. With no arguments, it returns an empty iterator.
- zip() is equivalent to:
```
def zip(*iterables):
    # zip('ABCD', 'xy') --> Ax By
    sentinel = object()
    iterators = [iter(it) for it in iterables]
    while iterators:
        result = []
        for it in iterators:
            elem = next(it, sentinel)
            if elem is sentinel:
                return
            result.append(elem)
        yield tuple(result)
```
- zip() should only be used with unequal length inputs when you donâ€™t care about trailing, unmatched values from the longer iterables.
### Enumerate()
- In this lecture we will learn about an extremely useful built-in function: enumerate(). Enumerate allows you to keep a count as you iterate through an object. It does this by returning a tuple in the form (count,element). The function itself is equivalent to:
```
def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
    n = start
    for elem in sequence:
        yield n, elem
        n += 1
```
### all() and any()
- all() and any() are built-in functions in Python that allow us to conveniently check for boolean matching in an iterable. - all() will return True if all elements in an iterable are True. It is the same as this function code:
```
def all(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if not element:
            return False
    return True
```
- any() will return True if any of the elements in the iterable are True. It is equivalent to the following function code:
```
def any(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if element:
            return True
    return False
```
### complex()
- complex() returns a complex number with the value real + imag*1j or converts a string or number to a complex number.
- If the first parameter is a string, it will be interpreted as a complex number and the function must be called without a second parameter. The second parameter can never be a string. Each argument may be any numeric type (including complex). If imag is omitted, it defaults to zero and the constructor serves as a numeric conversion like int and float. If both arguments are omitted, returns 0j.
- If you are doing math or engineering that requires complex numbers (such as dynamics, control systems, or impedance of a circuit) this is a useful tool to have in Python.
```
  # Create 2+3j
  complex(2,3)
```
## Decorator
- Use symbol '@' to excute the function.
